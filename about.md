We're **Mapuan Tech Startups**, a community of Mapuans and friends who are into technology business startups. This is our official website and we hope thru this we can form a community of tech startup enthusiasts to support and inspire each other.

We also hopeto be able to interest and inspire more Mapuans and Filipinos to take up the path of Technopreneurship as our contribution to the long-term development of the country's economy.

The Mapuan Tech Startups group was first formed off a [Facebook group](ttps://www.facebook.com/groups/225295784331139/) of former Technopreneurship and Feasibility Study students of Mapua Institute of Technology's Computer Engineering (CoE/CpE) program. Today, we have members who are from other programs and those who are not Mapuans and we welcome anyone who share our interests and endeavor.
