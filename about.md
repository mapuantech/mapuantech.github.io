## Mapúan Tech Startups: Connect, Collaborate, Create.

**Mapúan Tech Startups** is a community of students and alumni who are engaged in developing and promoting the culture of technology startup and entrepreneurship. We envision to create a space where tech startup enthusiasts can connect, collaborate and create.

By creating a culture of technopreneurship through meet ups, seminars and networking events, we want to inspire the Mapúa community and the Filipinos to take the path of technopreneurship as our contribution to the country’s development.

The Mapuan Tech Startups group was first formed off a [Facebook group](ttps://www.facebook.com/groups/225295784331139/) of former Technopreneurship and Feasibility Study students of Mapua Institute of Technology's Computer Engineering (CoE/CpE) program. Today, we have members who are from other programs and those who are not Mapuans and we welcome anyone who share our interests and endeavor.
